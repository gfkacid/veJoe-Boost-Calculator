# veJoe Boost APR Calculator

This calculator is my entry for TraderJoe's Bounty for a calculator react app to showcase how veJOE affects farming returns on boosted farms.

NOTE: Farm liquidity is a bit off from the number shown on TJ site, thus skewing the numbers a bit (~0.5% less APR observed by average for about 2AVAX worth of liquidity across various farms while testing)

## Setup

`yarn install`
`npm start`

## Requirements

* node v16+
* Web3 wallet provider on the client
